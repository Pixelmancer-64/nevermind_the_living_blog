# Nevermind the living blog

This is my personal blog! The name is a reference to the album "Nevermind the living dead" from "Stuck in the Sound". 

In this project in particular, I am using React, Next, @next/mdx (to compile my blog posts written in MDX), styled-components and @code-hike/mdx (to create the mdx code snippets)

I write about all kinds of subjects, but mainly web development, but I have some publications about web scraping, SQL querys and my work expirience in general.

Fell free to copy/follow this repository to create your own blog!
